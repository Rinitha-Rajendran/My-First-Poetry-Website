    <h2>BROKEN BOND AND BEYOND!</h2>
    <pre>
‘I will never hide!’
Now she says:” This is confidential! please do
not stand by my side,
She once said:”You are my guide!”
And to me she never lied!
The more I tried to near her,
The more I begin to fear her!
Our bond that was once unbreakable!
Now faded away!
Breaking my trust,
She is now treating me like dust!
And she moved away!

She was once a part of my kindred,
But now I am full of hatred!
Regretting the memories that we made, which
was more than a hundred!
We realised that all our promises were fake!
When our friendship started to break!
No more for her does my heart ache,
Those missed memories we are unable to
remake!
Pictures we were unable to retake!


And now our love is at stake!
Those past feelings make me shake!
Now that I am awake
To do without her!
Was the decision I should take!
You were once my cheerful token of ebullience!
Who now no more is my secret ingredient of my
resilience!
The one who always paid heed and liked my
feed,
Now asks ,”What do you need?”
And I knew that our friendship weed would no
longer breed!
As if separated by caste and creed!
To my ways she no longer agreed!
As if she was overtaken by greed!
Nor did I plead for our relationship to proceed!
My emotions began to recede,
When her ego began to exceed
But my heart bleeds!
When I think she will no more to my requests
accede or yield!
I began to protect myself like a shield!

She was my friend,
Who did not stay with me until the end!
Our ardent love became fragile,


She now became arrogant and is no longer with
the old same agile!
The time we spent were lost!
But it indeed was lots!
And now it did not last!
Fighting back my thoughts like tiny tots,
Our love was powerful like an ocean,
Now it has turned to awful commotion!
The torn pieces of hearts found in the game of
cards,
Now resembles the broken shards of my heart!
Our love for each other even though hard,
Away from it I try to ward !

To you the more I try to behold,
The more I grow cold,
Whenever your thoughts creep in my mind
silently I myself will scold!
And to my own stand I will always hold!
I will shift my focus to my talents that will
unfold!
But betrayal is something that I will never
uphold!
Our first meeting was indeed the best meeting!
Wasn’t it iconical?
But our last meeting was the worst meeting!
When the situation turned ironical!
Our meeting was just an hindrance!


That only strengthened my endurance!
And now that our friendship band is broken,
So many crazy things go unspoken!

They were the two best friends,
Who once said :”Our memories we will never
forget!”
They are now with nothing but only regrets!
They no longer shared a small,similar secret
They no longer spared one another but are now
of a different mind set!
‘Friendship’ is no longer their asset!
Again it can never be reset!
They are no more in each other's shoes,
They are now with changed views!
Over their past relationship they no longer
muse!
They are now swamped in printing their own
news!

The beauty of those bonds abated,
The celebrations for each other's birthday party
were no longer eagerly awaited!
Their bond was one so full of grace!
After each other they no longer chase!
They were each other's alter-ego,
But now they are of immense ego!



Their voice was like an intense echo,
To not treating or greeting each other like a
psycho,
To not waiting for each other individually and
outgo,
They now intellectually know what to do or
where to go!

Their chit chats which was once absurd,
Is now totally blurred.
Over each other they no longer observe!
The fruits of friendship they no longer deserve!
Four years they were freaking,
For years their friendship is breaking!
Their abundant memories which were whilom
difficult to erase!
Now reduced into the abandoned trace!

Their names written with the heart symbol was
still on the downy cushions,
Their thought of each other was of gloomy
questions !
But now they turned into strangers with different
visions!
Answering different questions,
And setting out on divergent missions!
As for memories they once cared !



Their simple secrets were no more shared!
And each other they no longer spared!
They had no clue as to why all of a sudden they
became blue!
Their friendship was momentary,
‘Their friendship was not true’ was what said
the commentary!

Their heart was drilled with feelings as hard as
a gun,
Their love for each other they send even in the
long run
Their separation once seemed like a misfortune ,
But their reparation now struck like a great
fortune !
As they were reminiscing their old false
feelings,
Their love grew cold and old and now they are
recognising their new dealings!
Though their love was not pure as gold,
they realised they would be able to do without
each other by being not brittle but bold!
To anything they required they no longer
appealed!
Their fake friendship and everything was
revealed!
