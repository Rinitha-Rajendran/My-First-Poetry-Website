If someone requests for something,
Ensure that you would never forget that one
thing and the very same thing.
When you can remember everything,
How could you forget that one thing!
When people place their trust on you,
Always have the thirst of not letting
their trust rust just because of you.

When they seek for 'GETTING' from you,
How could you speak of 'FORGETTING'-
when their requests are just a few.
When they seek for 'GETTING' from you,
How could you speak of 'FORGETTING'-
when their requests are a few.
Look for the resources to help out of,
Of your 'remembrance'-please don't run
short of.
Convince them with your help of their wish
that is warm,
Don't confuse them, but make them retain
their calm.

If you can't confirm of your help or lend your
hand,
Inform them yourself beforehand!
If you can not bend to their request,
Refuse it at first and for other ways they can
search or quest.
Try helping them best, so that they are not
in their mind's contest of conquest.
Your promises you should keep,
Of their need, your mind should pay heed
and constantly remind and beep.
In case you are unable to help,remember to
show them all the other ways that creep and
never let them weep.
Whatever they ask for or succour,
Forever ensure that it would somehow or
however occur,
In no way, any trouble you should incur,
And never let them suffer.
You should concur for them to conquer!

They being in tears is something you
shouldn't induce.
They being in happy tears is something you
should introduce and infuse.

Be that person whom they will remember for
years and for your favours,
Forever you will feel proud and famous!
Understand that seeking for your help and
searching for a right person to help is an
object of 'CONCLUSION'.
Do not make that decision subject to a
matter of 'CONFUSION'.
Understand their condition,
And stand by your conviction.
It was you-that someone whom they could
find,
It was to you to whom their need for help
was defined.
Please don't nod when you already know
that you can't afford.
Never use the lame excuse-that is 'I forgot'
Whenever you feel that heping them is a
matter of doubt,
Please do tell it out!
It is your choice to resign or assign
And choose to always remind.

Remember that 'refusal' is better than
'betrayal'.
Loving God in the church ,
And Leaving people in the lurch,
Should not be your principle,
Help people and prove yourself to be His
best desciple!
'Generosity and Genuineness' is what
should always and forever harbour.
'Absent-mindedness' is something that
never should be your armour.
No matter how many 'biddings' you get,
On fulfilling and favouring them,
double the 'blessings' you will beget!
Be that person whom they would never
forget,

and,

Become that person who is without any
regrets!

Be that person who is reachableðŸ˜Š
Become that person who is reliableðŸ˜Ž
